                <p>I am a Designer and Full-Stack Developer based in Columbus, OH.

                    Graphic design and illustration were my gateway into creative work which led my first steps into the tech world. I stumbled upon basic HTML and CSS tutorials during my early undergrad years, and consequently fell in love with with the potential of not only being able to visualize my ideas but also develop them from the ground up on my own as well. 
                    
                    Out of this interest for development, my passion for functionality and structure evolved. Jumping right into Photoshop to create something didnâ€™t feel accurate anymore and skipping the steps of building a framework based on functionality and usability became inevitable. This is why I decided to pursue my degree in Communication Technology and New Media with a focus in Human Computer Interaction at the Ohio State University. My program taught me a the components necessary to keep a user-centered mindset and awareness for design throughout the development of digital experiences.
                    
                    Currently, I am participating in a full-stack development apprenticeship I started one week out of graduation. Agile full-stack software development, intensive hands-on projects, and collaborative programming have become my day to day. I am still open to full-time opportunities, so if you are aware of any that you'd think I fit into, kindly let me know. Thank you!
