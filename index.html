        <div class = "text-1">
  <p>I am a Designer and Full-Stack Developer based in Columbus, OH. </p>
  
  
     <strong>Web Development</strong>
        <br>
      
          <p>I stumbled upon basic HTML and CSS tutorials during my early undergrad years, and consequently fell in 
          love with with the potential of not only being able to visualize my ideas but also develop them from the 
          ground up on my own as well. Out of this interest for development, my passion for functionality and structure 
          evolved. Jumping right into Photoshop to create something didnâ€™t feel accurate anymore and skipping the steps of building
          a framework based on functionality and usability became inevitable.</p>
  
        </div>
   <div class = "text-2">
      <strong>Design</strong>
      <br>
          <p> A user-centered mindset and awareness for design turned out to be the perfect fit for me whils
          creating on my own as well as when collaborating with others. This rough framework outlines
          my process of developing digital experiences:

              <li class = "bodylist2"> CONCEPT AND STRATEGYÂ </li>
              <li class = "bodylist2"> CREATE, evaluate and iterate deliverables such asâ€¨</span></li>

          </ol>
          Communicating the conceptual approach/strategy and reasoning behind it, is present during the
          whole process. </p>
